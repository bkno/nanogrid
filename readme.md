# NanoGrid

The intention of NanoGrid is to make the HTML and CSS markup as simple as possible, without the need for additional dependencies such as SASS. Supports every browser from IE6 upwards.

## HTML

Example: one big column followed by two smaller ones:

    <div class="grid3 first">
      6 columns
    </div>
    <div class="grid3">
      3 columns
    </div>
    <div class="grid3">
      3 columns
    </div>
